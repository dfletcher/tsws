# tsws

TSWS, A Totally Simple Web Server in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
and [Socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) or alternatively
[Netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/).

### Getting Started Example

    sudo apt-get install socat
    git clone https://github.com/dfletcher/tsws.git
    cd tsws
    ./tsws 127.0.0.1 8080 &
    chromium http://127.0.0.1:8080

### Installation Notes

Socat (`socat`) is recommended over Netcat (`nc`) and Socat is required for
correct operation on the Cygwin platform. The script first checks for `socat`
and uses that if available. If not, it checks for `nc` and uses that as a
fallback solution.

#### If you cannot install Socat

There are a lot of variations of the `nc` program around and it might not work.
If `nc` complains about a missing -k option, you could try calling the script in
a loop to emulate the operation:

    while : ; do ./tsws localhost 8080; done

This will not work well on Cygwin or other Windows based Bash distributions, the
delay of launching an executable will cause too much downtime, the browser will
often be trying to connect while this is looping and will get no response
because it is not listening for connections for an extended period of time.

### You can use TSWS as a library:

    TSWS_LIBRARY=1 . tsws
    declare www_index_Content_Type="text/html; charset=utf-8"
    function www_index {
      echo "<html><body>My index is better than the default.</body></html>"
    }
    tsws 127.0.0.1 8080

for many more details and discussion, including theory of operation and
creating dynamic content.

### Known issues and bugs

- !GAPING SECURITY HOLE WARNING!
  Do not trust the input. An attempt is made to scrub requests, it may not
  be 100% complete (this project is brand-spankin' new). The core engine
  looks for bash functions named similarly to the path. These are prefixed
  with "www_". Think carefully when writing functions named similarly,
  ensure that values coming from the network cannot be evaluated.

- This setup almost certainly has issues with concurrency. It is useful for
  a single local user or demonstration purposes, but please do not use it
  as a production web server connected to the internet.

- All HTTP caching is ignored keep things simple.

- Cygwin doesn't work so great. Particularly, some requests just fail
  inexplicably with nc never supplying a request or supplying a massively
  delayed one.

- It is easily confused, especially if multiple browsers or tabs are
  pointed to it at the same time. Requests and responses might get dropped
  (still not quite sure why on that) and the order can get out of whack,
  sending the wrong file for a request.

- Iterative development is awkward. Altering functions while bash is
  running confuses it, and the server must be restarted to see changes.

- Parsing CGI variables off URLs is weak. TODO find a decent way to do it
  that doesn't baloon the example code.
